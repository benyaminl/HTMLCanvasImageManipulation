# HTMLCanvasImageManipulation
And project to madana tiles, errr, when you click a pixel, then you can change pixel color, go then

## The canvas have broke
Sometimes the HTML canvas goes blank so I export the URI data to a image so it will last there 

## The Available Feature
1. Color Picking (using html5)
2. Color change (Using floodFill algorithym)
3. Simulate it in a Room (Using some trapezoid, perspective and some of the other like skew left right up down, to make it more real as like in high school when drawing using pencil on some perpective using 1 dot, 2 dot, or else)
